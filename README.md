# LaundryLocker

Laundry is a chore that most people dread. I know I do. The thought of sorting, washing, drying, and folding clothes can be overwhelming, especially for those with busy schedules. And if you’re someone who loves clothes like me, then we have the drycleaning. And it’s the type of chore that never ends, for as long as we exist.

This is where Laundry Locker comes in. Laundry Locker is a hypothesis that provides convenient and efficient laundry services. They offer a locker system where customers can drop off their laundry and pick it up when it’s ready. With Laundry Locker, customers can save time and energy while still having clean clothes.

Before launching any product or service, it’s essential to conduct market research to understand the needs and preferences of the target audience. This is why I have created a product research survey to gather insights from potential customers. This survey aims to understand the current laundry habits of respondents, their pain points, and the features they would like to see in a laundry service.

This survey should take less than 5 minutes to complete and it would be a big help in understanding how potential users experience the pain points that we aim to solve.

Thank you in advance for your time :)
